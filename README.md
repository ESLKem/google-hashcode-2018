My team's solution to the Qualification Round problem.

## Scores
A - example: 10  
B - should be easy: 176,877  
C - no hurry: 15,541,379  
D - metropolis: 7,307,087  
E - high bonus: 21,465,945  
**Total: 44,491,298** 

## Approach
Due to different data inputs and distributions we decided to adapt the algorithm for different use cases which in turn let us solve *B*, *C* and *E* fairly efficiently. *A* used a randomized solution for fun.

## How to compile
This MS Visual Studio solution uses 3 different source files for different data variations.  
To compile any of the three source files in the solution you'll have to comment out the other two.
